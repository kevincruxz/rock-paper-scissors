# rock-paper-scissors
Implementation of the classical game rock-scissors-paper, in a new version named sword, shield and crossbow.

The rules essentialy are the same, one thing beats another and another beats it, in this particular case the rules are:
-Sword breaks the crossbow (win), and gets covered by the shield (lose).
-Shield covers the sword (win), and gets traversed by the crossbow (lose).
-Crossbow breaks through the shield (win), and gets destroyed by the sword (lose).
-First to win 5 rounds wins the match.

I developed a GUI for this game with css and html, and the application in javascript.
